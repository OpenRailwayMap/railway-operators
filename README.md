railway-operators
=================

 This repository contains a machine-readable list of railway operators including trains, trams, metros, subways and light rails.

 It is not intended to collect any detailled information about the lines. Such information can be found in OpenStreetMap.

 The initial goal was to maintain an up to date list of railway companies around the world for quality assurance of OpenStreetMap data, such as detecting misspelled operators.

## Datasets

This repository contains two datasets in CSV format. For easier maintanance, the lists are sorted by `country` and `operator_short_name`.
